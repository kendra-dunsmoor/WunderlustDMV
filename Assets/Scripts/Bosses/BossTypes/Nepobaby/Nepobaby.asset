  openingDialogueLines:
  - "Are you the newbie? I thought we\u2019d fired you already. Whatever, we can
    get that done now."
  actionDialogueLines:
  - "There\u2019s a misconception that I need you to keep the bureaucracy stable,
    but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see that you actually need me more to keep your
    livelihood! "
  - "Daddy said I\u2019d have difficult employees, but you don\u2019t have to be
    so horrible!"
  - "Leave pity city and just do your job! No one\u2019s asking you to have feelings
    about it."
  - "Stop thinking about losing the bonuses I haven\u2019t offered you, and start
    thinking about your lack of skills in your position! "
  - "I destroyed the DMV union! What makes you think I can\u2019t do the same to
    you?"
  neutralDialogueLines:
  - 'Your horrible performance is why you haven''t earned any cookies; those are
    for closers. '
  - "You\u2019re right. Astaroth has been pretty slow. I\u2019ll have to ask her
    about that next time. I could do better with half her hours on the floor!"
  positiveDialogueLines:
  - "I am the best, you\u2019re right. Daddy always told me that\u2019s why I got
    this job."
  - "I\u2019m sure that you can now see that your work would have been much worse
    without my oversight and that daddy was right about how amazing I am."
  negativeDialogueLines:
  - "Your queue was twice as long as Verrine\u2019s last week. Were you spending
    too long in the break room instead of cleaning up the afterlife?"
  - "Maybe your issues aren\u2019t rooted in your work ethic, and are instead a morality
    problem; you\u2019re letting too many people into  the afterlife!"
  transitionDialogueLines:
  - So, what do you have to say for yourself?
